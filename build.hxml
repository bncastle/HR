#the -cp sets the class path that points to where the source files can be found
-cp src
-main HR 
-cpp bin
--no-traces
-dce full
# -D HXCPP_VERBOSE=1
#note: I've modified:
#C:\Users\<username>\haxelib\hxcpp\3,4,64\include\hx\Tls.h
# so that this will compile with VS2017 with the current version of Haxe (3.4.2)
# and HXCPP (3.4.64)
#Also had to add HXCPP_MSVC to my Environment variables
